How useContext Works: A Detailed Explanation

The useContext hook allows you to access context values directly in your components. It is essentially a bridge between the context provider (which holds the shared state or data) and the consumer components (which need that shared data).

Thought Map for Using useContext
Here’s a step-by-step mental framework for using useContext in your future projects:

       1.  Identify the Shared Data
           Ask:     What data or state needs to be shared across multiple components?
           Example: A theme (light/dark), user authentication status, or language preference.
           Action:  Create a context (using createContext) to manage this shared data.

       2.  Create a Context and Provider
         Purpose: A context acts as a centralized storage for shared data, and a provider makes it available to the component tree.
         Provider’s Job: Manage the state logic and expose it via the value prop.
         Action: Write a provider component to encapsulate the state and any functions related to it.
                 Wrap your app (or parts of it) with this provider.

        3.  Consume the Context
            Purpose: Access and use the shared data in your components without prop drilling.
            useContext: A hook that connects a component to the context and gives access to its values.
            Action: Use useContext in any child component to consume the data and actions provided by the context.

         4. Keep It Modular
            Best Practice: Encapsulate each context into its own file/module.
            Why: This keeps the codebase clean and makes each context reusable.



            Implementation Thought Map
            When implementing useContext, visualize it like this:

1.  Top-Level Provider: Think of the provider as a "store" that holds your shared data.
    Question: What state needs to be shared? (e.g., theme, user, cart items)
    Answer: Create the provider and manage this state within it.

Context Consumers: These are "customers" that take data from the provider.

2. Question: Which components need access to this shared state?
   Answer: Use useContext in those components to get and use the data.

3. Flow:
   Provider → Wraps your app or specific parts → Supplies shared data.
   Consumers → Use useContext to access the data.

   [Build a Provider Component] - Manages shared state - Exposes state and functions via `value`

   [Wrap the Provider around Components Needing Data]
   ↓
   [Consume Context Data in Components] - Use `useContext` to access and update shared data
